This repo will use the gradle tool chain for building the following for Courses:

- HTML for online courses
- HTML for reveal.js slide presentations
- PDF


This repo will use the gradle tool chain for building the following for Browser Guides:

- HTML Neo Browser guides
- PDF

== Prerequisites

Since we are using the {uri-gradle-wrapper}[Gradle Wrapper], the only requirement is to have {uri-java-download}[Java] installed.

> A Java version between 8 and 13 is required to execute Gradle. Java 14 and later versions are not yet supported.

https://docs.gradle.org/6.0/release-notes.html

== Using the Gradle Wrapper

On Windows, open a terminal and type:

 $ gradlew.bat

On Linux and macOS, open a terminal and type:

 $ ./gradlew

If you run this command for the first time it will download and install Gradle.
Make sure that you have an unrestricted access to Internet (ie. not behind a corporate proxy).

== Tasks

In the following examples, we are going to use the command `./gradlew`.
If you are using Windows, don't forget to replace `./gradlew` by `gradlew.bat`.

.Convert to HTML
 $ ./gradlew convertOnlineHtml

.Convert to PDF
 $ ./gradlew convertOnlinePdf

.Convert to reveal.js
 $ ./gradlew convertSlides

All the generated files will be available at [.path]_modules/\{moduleName}/build_.

If you want to convert all the files at once, you can use the `convert` task:

 $ ./gradlew convert

You can also run a task on a specific module:

 $ ./gradlew :demo:convertOnlineHtml
 $ ./gradlew :demo:convert

Or multiple tasks:

 $ ./gradlew :demo:convertOnlinePdf :demo:convertSlides

Gradle will do his best to detect if a task needs to be run again or not.
If you want to force Gradle to execute a task again, you can remove the `build` directory using the `clean` task:

 $ ./gradlew clean

Once the `build` directory is removed, type the task you want to execute.

You can also clean a particular directory:

 $ ./gradlew :demo:clean

== Local development mode

// QUESTION: As far as I understand, in the future, we will only have two stages: testing (private page on WordPress) > production (public page on WordPress)
// So we should probably update this section because the "local" stage does not exist anymore.
When converting the online training, you can define the property "stage" to "local" to avoid loading analytics and token validation code in the HTML pages:

 $ ./gradlew :demo:convertOnlineHtml -Pstage=local

== LiveReload

To enable {uri-livereload}[LiveReload], you will need to install the {uri-livereload-webstore}[LiveReload browser extension] on Chrome.
Once it's done you should have a new icon on the right of your address bar:

image::livereload-icon.png[]

Next, you need to open two terminal.
In the first one, type the following command to continuously convert the AsciiDoc source to a reveal.js presentation:

[source,console]
----
$ ./gradlew --continuous :demo:convertSlides
----

On the second one, type the following command to start the LiveReload server on the [.path]_demo_ module:

[source,console]
----
$ ./gradlew :demo:liveReload

> Task :liveReload
Enabling LiveReload at port 35729 for /path/to/modules/demo/build
----

You're all set!

Now, open Chrome and navigate to the HTML file of your choice, for instance: http://localhost:35729/slides/04_IntroductionToCypherPresentation.html.
Don't forget to enable the LiveReload extension on your browser by clicking on the icon:

image::livereload-enabled.png[]

Notice that the middle circle is now filled in black.

If you edit the corresponding AsciiDoc source (or resources), and wait a few seconds, your browser will automatically be refreshed with your changes.

[NOTE]
====
Similarly, you can use LiveReload with the online training using:

 $ ./gradlew --continuous :demo:convertOnlineHtml -Penv=dev
====

== Add a new module

To add a new module, edit the [.path]_settings.gradle_ file at the root of this project.
For instance, if we want to add a new module named `browser" located at [.path]_modules/browser-guides_, we need to add the following lines:

[source,gradle]
----
include 'browser'
project(':browser').projectDir = file('modules/browser-guides')
----

Now we can execute tasks on this new module, for instance: `./gradlew :browser:convert`


== Viewing slides locally

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the folder where the slides HTML resides, for example:

cd modules/demo/build/slides

2. Start the Web server:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

3. View the slides in a Web Browser by going to localhost:8080

[square]
* `ESC` to see summary slides
* Page down/Page up to move from slide to slide
* Option + Click to zoom in/zoom out
* S to open speaker notes in a different window
