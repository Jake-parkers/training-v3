== Analysis of commonly used together ingredients (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup,  *Load Data*, and *Node Similarity* steps again.

== Analysis of commonly used together ingredients (Overview)

Now that you have familiarized yourself with graph algorithms and how to execute them in the Graph Data Science library, you will do a quick graph analysis of the Recipes Dataset.
In this exercise, you will find communities of commonly used together ingredients and the representatives of those communities:

* *Part 1*: Project the ingredients graph to Graph Catalog with native projection.
* *Part 2*: Run the Node Similarity algorithm to evaluate the distribution of the Jaccard index similarity score.
* *Part 3*: Run the Node Similarity algorithm to mutate a relationship between a pair of commonly used together ingredients.
* *Part 4*: Run the Louvain Modularity algorithm to add a community property to each node.
* *Part 5*: Write the relationships stored in a named in-memory graph back to Neo4j.
* *Part 6*: Investigate the community detection results.
* *Part 7*: Inspect the top five largest communities of ingredients.
* *Part 8*: Find representatives of the top five communities with the PageRank algorithm.

== Part 1: Project the ingredients graph to Graph Catalog with native projection. (Instructions)

Write Cypher code to project the Ingredient graph to Graph Catalog using these guidelines:

* The created graph should be named *ingredient*.
* Project all nodes labeled *Ingredient* and *Recipe*.
* Project all relationships with a type *CONTAINS_INGREDIENT*.
* Relationships should use the *REVERSE* orientation.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.graph.create`.

== Part 2: Run the Node Similarity algorithm to evaluate the distribution of the Jaccard index similarity score. (Instructions)

We will evaluate the Jaccard similarity score distribution to helps us fine-tune the *topK* and *similarityCutoff* parameters of the Node Similarity algorithm in the next step.

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *ingredient*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following result: nodesCompared,similarityDistribution.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.nodeSimilarity.stats`.

The average Jaccard similarity score is relatively low at 0.10 value.
Due to the low average similarity score, we will have to select a low similarity cutoff value in the next step.
Otherwise, we might infer too sparse of a similarity network, which will not yield relevant results.

* The algorithm will mutate a relationship with a type *COMMONLY_USED_TOGETHER* between a pair of ingredients.
* The algorithm will mutate a property named *score* to each relationship with the computed value.
* Specify a similarity cutoff threshold of 0.3.
* Specify the *topK* parameter of 10.
* `YIELD` the following result: nodesCompared, relationshipsWritten.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.nodeSimilarity.mutate`.

The algorithm has written 1260 similarity relationships between 1384 nodes.
Even with the low similarity cutoff value, the inferred network is still relatively sparse.

== Part 4: Run the Louvain Modularity algorithm to add a community property to each node. (Instructions)

The algorithm found three hierarchical levels of communities with a total of 952 communities on the last level.
We already knew that our inferred similarity network is sparse, so a high number of communities is not surprising.
Probably a lot of communities consist of only a single node.
Next, we will investigate single node communities to test our hypothesis.

== Part 5: Write the relationships stored in a named in-memory graph back to Neo4j. (Instructions)

To investigate the inferred similarity network, we have to write the mutated relationships stored in named graph back to Neo4j.

* The procedure should use the projected graph *ingredient*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* The procedure will write relationships with a type *COMMONLY_USED_TOGETHER* back to Neo4j.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.graph.writeRelationship`.

There are 743 nodes without any *COMMONLY_USED_TOGETHER* relationship, and consequently, there are 743 communities that contain only a single node.
This means that out of a total of 952 communities found by the Louvain Algorithm, only 209 of them consist of more than a single node.

== Part 7: Inspect the top five largest communities of ingredients. (Instructions)

Write a query to return all *ingredient_community* values of the *Ingredient* nodes.
For each community id, return the size of the community, and the list of *Ingredient* names.

* Return a list of 3 ingredients for each community.
* Order the results by component size descending.
* Limit it to the top five results.

The largest community contains 18 ingredients, while the second community consists of 15 ingredients.
On average, the communities are relatively small.
It seems that our recipes dataset contains a variety of dishes that do not have many ingredients in common.

== Analysis of commonly used together ingredients: Taking it further

. Change the similarityCutoff and topK parameters to see how it affects the results.
. Try using Overlap Similarity instead of Node Similarity algorithm.
. Try doing the same analysis for recipes instead of ingredients.
