== Load Data for the Exercises (Preparations)

Before you perform the exercises for this course, complete the following steps:

. Install Neo4j Desktop.
. Create a Project named *Graph Algos*.
. Create a local 4.1 database.
. Install the APOC plugin for use with this database.
. Install the Graph Data Science plugin for use with this database.
. Install the Graph Data Science Playground Graph App.
. Start the database.
. Start the Graph Data Science Playground Graph App.

Go to the next page to load the data.

== Step 1: Load the data from Graph Data Science Playground

In Graph Data Science Playground:

. Click the database icon in the left panel.
. Click *Select* , followed by *Yes, load it!* to load these datasets:
.. Game of Thrones
.. European Roads
.. Recipes

[NOTE]
Do [underscore]#not# load the Twitter dataset as it conflicts with the other datasets!

== Step 2: Load some other data from Neo4j Browser

In Neo4j Browser, execute this code:

[source, cypher]
----
MERGE (nAlice:Person {name:'Alice'})
MERGE (nBridget:Person {name:'Bridget'})
MERGE (nCharles:Person {name:'Charles'})
MERGE (nDoug:Person {name:'Doug'})
MERGE (nMark:Person {name:'Mark'})
MERGE (nMichael:Person {name:'Michael'})
MERGE (nAlice)-[:HELPS{weight:5.0}]->(nBridget)
MERGE (nAlice)-[:HELPS{weight:1.5}]->(nCharles)
MERGE (nMark)-[:HELPS{weight:2.0}]->(nDoug)
MERGE (nMark)-[:HELPS{weight:1.7}]->(nMichael)
MERGE (nBridget)-[:HELPS{weight:0.5}]->(nMichael)
MERGE (nDoug)-[:HELPS{weight:1.1}]->(nMark)
MERGE (nMichael)-[:HELPS{weight:0.5}]->(nAlice)
MERGE (nAlice)-[:HELPS{weight:1.1}]->(nMichael)
MERGE (nBridget)-[:HELPS{weight:2.6}]->(nAlice)
MERGE (nMichael)-[:HELPS{weight:1.8}]->(nBridget)
----

Then execute this code:

[source, cypher]
----
MERGE (neo4j:Tag {name:'neo4j'})
MERGE (graphql:Tag {name:'graphql'})
MERGE (cypher:Tag {name:'cypher'})
MERGE (graph:Tag {name:'graph'})
MERGE (python:Tag {name:'python'})
MERGE (html:Tag {name:'html'})
MERGE (css:Tag {name:'css'})
MERGE (js:Tag {name:'javascript'})

MERGE (query:Question {name: "How can I optimize this query in neo4j?"})
MERGE (path:Question {name: "Neo4j finding a path between two stations"})
MERGE (grand:Question {name: "How to write relationship mutation in GraphQL using GRANDstack?"})
MERGE (pythonq:Question {name: "Quicker way to write a dict to a neo4j database using python"})
MERGE (list:Question {name: "How to make a responsive horizontal list"})
MERGE (box:Question {name: "3D box tilt with JavaScript and css"})

MERGE (query)-[:HAS_TAG]->(graph)
MERGE (query)-[:HAS_TAG]->(neo4j)
MERGE (query)-[:HAS_TAG]->(cypher)

MERGE (path)-[:HAS_TAG]->(neo4j)
MERGE (path)-[:HAS_TAG]->(cypher)
MERGE (path)-[:HAS_TAG]->(graph)

MERGE (grand)-[:HAS_TAG]->(neo4j)
MERGE (grand)-[:HAS_TAG]->(graphql)

MERGE (pythonq)-[:HAS_TAG]->(neo4j)
MERGE (pythonq)-[:HAS_TAG]->(python)
MERGE (pythonq)-[:HAS_TAG]->(cypher)

MERGE (list)-[:HAS_TAG]->(html)
MERGE (list)-[:HAS_TAG]->(css)

MERGE (box)-[:HAS_TAG]->(html)
MERGE (box)-[:HAS_TAG]->(css)
MERGE (box)-[:HAS_TAG]->(js)
----


== Step 3: Verify data has been loaded.

After you have loaded the data, open a Neo4j Browser window to the started database and view the database information.

It should appear as follows:

image::DataLoaded.png[DataLoaded,width=400,role=left]


Your database should now look as follows:

[.thumb]
image::LoadedDatabase.png[LoadedDatabase,width=150]

Refresh the database contents in NEuler to have the new datasets available for algorithm execution.

The database contents in NEuler should look as follows:

image::LoadedNEuler.png[LoadedDatabase,width=150]

== Load Data for the Exercises (Summary)

Your database is now set up and ready for you to gain experience with graph algorithms.
