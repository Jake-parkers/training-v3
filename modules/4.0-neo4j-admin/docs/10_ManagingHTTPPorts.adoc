== About this module

Next, you will learn how to adjust access to the databases with HTTP ports.

== Configuring connector ports for the Neo4j instance

The Neo4j instance uses https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.5/configuration/ports/[default port numbers] that may conflict with other processes on your system.
The ports frequently used are the connector ports:

[cols="10,10,80", options="header",stripes="none"]
|====
| *Name*
| *Port Number*
| *Description*
|
{set:cellbgcolor:white}
HTTP
| 7474
| Used by Neo4j Browser. It is *not* encrypted so it should never be exposed externally.
| HTTPS
| 7473
| Requires additional SSL configuration.
| Bolt
| 7687
| Bolt connection used by Neo4j Browser, cypher-shell, and client applications.
|====
{set:cellbgcolor!}

=== Default configuration: Connector ports

Here are the default settings for connector ports:

image::DefaultConnectorPorts.png[DefaultConnectorPorts,width=600,align=center]

Notice that by default the HTTPS connector is disabled, but the default HTTP port is 7474 and the default bolt port is 7687.
If any of these ports conflict with ports already used on your system, you can change these connector ports by modifying these property values in the *neo4j.conf* file.

=== Connector ports: Development vs. production

In a development mode, clients can connect to the Neo4j instance using the bolt or HTTP connector ports.
This is fine in a development environment only where access from different systems in your network are allowed.

By default, a Neo4j instance cannot be accessed by a client running on a different system.
If you want to allow external connections to the Neo4j instance, you must set this property:

----
dbms.connectors.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0
----

In production, an application that needs to connect to the Neo4j instance from a different system, should use a secure (encrypted) connection.
In this course, we will not be configuring secure HTTPs connectors as we need a real CA for a real company to do this.
You should consult the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/security/ssl-framework/[SSL documentation] for details in your real, production environment.

== Check your understanding

=== Question 1

Suppose that you have installed Neo4j Enterprise Edition and have modified the name of the active database in the Neo4j configuration file. What tool and command do you run to create the new database?

Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] `neo4j-admin create-database`
- [ ] `neo4j-admin initialize`
- [ ] `neo4j create-database`
- [x] `neo4j start`

=== Question 2

Suppose that you want the existing Neo4j database to have the name *ABCRecommendations.db*. Assuming that you have stopped the Neo4j instance, what steps must you perform to modify the name of the database, which currently has a default name of *graph.db*?

Select the correct answers.

[%interactive.answers]
- [x] Rename the *NEO4J_HOME/graph.db* directory to *NEO4J_HOME/ABCRecommendations.db*.
- [x] Modify *neo4j.conf* to use _dbms.active_database=ABCRecommendations.db_.
- [ ] [Run `neo4j-admin rename graph.db ABCRecommendations.db`.
- [ ] Run `neo4j-admin move graph.db ABCRecommendations.db`.

=== Question 3

How do you copy a database that you want to give to another user?

Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] With the Neo4j instance started, run `neo4j-admin copy` providing the location where the copy will be created.
- [ ] With the Neo4j instance stopped, run `neo4j-admin copy` providing the location where the copy will be created.
- [ ] With the Neo4j instance started, run `neo4j-admin dump` providing the location where the dump file will be created.
- [x] With the Neo4j instance stopped, run `neo4j-admin dump` providing the location where the dump file will be created.

== Summary

You should now be able to change HTTP and bolt ports for your Neo4j instance.
