= Exercise #4: Creating and deleting a database
// for local preview
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

In this exercise you will gain some experience with creating and deleting a database.

== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your Neo4j Docker instance for this course.
. Ensure that the Docker Neo4j instance is started.

== Exercise steps:

. Connect to the Neo4j instance with `cypher-shell`.
. Enter the command to show all databases.
+
    *Hint*: You must use the system database.

[start=3]
. Enter the command to create a database named _databaseone_.
. Enter the command to show all databases.
+

. Exit `cypher-shell`.
. View the directories where the databases are located for this instance.
+

*Note*:  Normally in Debian, you simply modify the *conf/neo4j.conf* file to make changes to the Neo4j instance when it starts.
In a Docker Neo4j instance, it is a little different.

With the Docker Neo4j instance, it uses its own internal configuration, but you can override configuration settings in one of two ways.

. One is with the settings you specify when you create the Docker instance (*create_neo4j_instance.sh*).
. The other way is to specify configuration values in a *neo4j.conf* file that is located in the shared volume used by the Docker Neo4j Docker instance. This is how you will add configuration changes to the Neo4j instance for this training.
+

[start=5]
. Create the *neo4j.conf* file in the *$HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/conf* directory created when you created the Docker Neo4j instance.
. Add the `dbms.default.database` property for *databaseone* to this file.

----
sudo vi ~/docker-neo4j/neo4j/neo4j.conf
Enter "i" to enter input mode.
Enter dbms.default.database=databaseone
Press ESC to get out of input mode.
Type ":w" to write the changes to the file.
Type ":q" to quit the editor
----

Your neo4j.conf file should be as follows:

image::AddConfigDatabaseoneDocker.png[AddConfigDatabaseoneDocker,width=1000,align=center]

[start=7]
. Restart the Docker Neo4j instance. Any change to the Neo4j configuration file requires a restart of the Neo4j instance.
+

----
[sudo] docker stop neo4j
[sudo] docker start neo4j
----

. Connect to the Neo4j instance with `cypher-shell`.
. Enter the command to show all databases to confirm that _databaseone_ is now the default database.

image::CheckDefaultDatabaseDocker.png[CheckDefaultDatabaseDocker,width=1000,align=center]

[start=10]
. Drop the database _neo4j_.
. Enter the command to show all databases.
+

image::RemovedNeo4jDocker.png[RemovedNeo4jDocker,width=1000,align=center]

. Exit `cypher-shell`.

== Taking it further

. Try resetting a database that has data in it.
. Try conditionally creating a database.

== Exercise summary

You have now successfully added and dropped a database, as well as specifying a different database as the default database for clients.
