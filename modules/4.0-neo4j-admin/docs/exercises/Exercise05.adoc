== *Exercise #5: Copying databases*

In this exercise, you will use `neo4j-admin` to copy a database and create a database from a dump file.

=== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your EC2 instance for this course.
. Ensure that you are the user _neo4j_.
. Ensure that the Neo4j instance is started.

=== Exercise steps

*Part 1*: First you will create a movies database that will be used in this exercise for copying.

. In `cypher-shell` create a database named _movies_.
. Exit out of `cypher-shell`.
. Invoke `cypher-shell` using *movieDB.cypher* as input and specify _movies_ as the database.
----
/usr/bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <Neo4jInstancePassword> --database movies < /home/ubuntu/files/movieDB.cypher
----
[start=4]
. In `cypher-shell` confirm that the database was loaded. It should contain 171 nodes:
----
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
----

*Part 2*: You will make a copy of the _movies_ database, _movies2_ for local use in the Neo4j instance.

. In `cypher-shell` stop the _movies_ database.
. Exit `cypher-shell`.
. Copy the _movies_ database to the _movies2_ database using the neo4j-admin tool:
----
/usr/bin/neo4j-admin copy --from-database=movies --to-database=movies2
----
[start=4]
. In `cypher-shell' create _movies2_.
. Confirm that this _movies2_ database has 171 nodes.
----
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
----

*Part 3*: You will dump the _movies_ database.

. Use the `dump` command of the `neo4j-admin` tool to create the dump file as follows:
----
/usr/bin/neo4j-admin dump --database=movies --to=/home/ubuntu/files/movies.dump
----
[start=2]
. Confirm that the *movies.dump* file was created.

*Part 4*: You use the dump file to create a database.

. Use the `load` command of the `neo4j-admin` tool to create the database, _movies3_ from the dump file as follows:
----
/usr/bin/neo4j-admin load --database=movies3 --from=/home/ubuntu/files/movies.dump
----
[start=2]
. In `cypher-shell' create _movies3_.
. Confirm that this _movies3_ database has 171 nodes.

=== Exercise summary

You have now gained experience copying a database within the Neo4j instance and also creating a dump file that can be used to create a database on a different system.

== *Exercise #6: Modifying the location of the databases*

In this Exercise, you will set up a different location for the databases in your local filesystem and start the Neo4j instance using the database at this new location.

=== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your EC2 instance for this course.
. Ensure that you are the user _neo4j_.
. Ensure that the Neo4j instance is stopped.
. You should have previously created the dump file, *movies.dump* for the movie database in the *~/files directory*.

=== Exercise steps:


. Create a directory named *~/neo4j-databases*. This is the directory where the databases will reside which is different from the default location used by Neo4j.
. Make sure that this *neo4j-databases* directory is owned by _neo4j:neo4j_.
. Modify the *neo4j.conf* file to use */home/ubuntu/neo4j-databases* as the data directory. Also ensure that there the default database is _maindb_. Your *neo4j.conf* file should look something like this:

image::BestPracticeConfigChangesAtEnd.png[BestPracticeConfigChangesAtEnd,width=900,align=center]

[start=5]
. Start the Neo4j instance.
. Examine the log file to ensure that the instance started without errors.
. Examine the files in the */home/ubuntu/neo4j-databases* location. The instance should have created the *databases* and *transactions* directories. The *databases* directory should look as follows:

image::Neo4jStarted-newLocation2.png[Neo4jStarted-newLocation2,width=800,align=center]

[start=8]
. Connect to the _maindb_ database using `cypher-shell`. Did you need to change the password?
. Exit `cypher-shell`.
. Use the `load` command of the `neo4j-admin` tool to create the database, _movies_ from the dump file as follows:
----
/usr/bin/neo4j-admin load --database=movies --from=/home/ubuntu/files/movies.dump
----
[start=11]
. In `cypher-shell' create _movies_.
. Confirm that this _movies_ database has 171 nodes.

=== Exercise summary

You have now configured the Neo4j instance to use a different location for the databases.

== *Exercise #7: Checking consistency of a database*

In this Exercise, you check the consistency of a database that is consistent. Then you modify a file that causes the database to become corrupt and then check its consistency.

=== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your EC2 instance for this course.
. Ensure that you are the user _neo4j_.
. Ensure that the Neo4j instance is started.

=== Exercise steps:

. Use `cypher-shell` to load the *movies.dump* data into a database named _movies2_.
. Use `cypher-shell` to create the _movies2_ database.
. Confirm that this database has 171 nodes.
. Stop the _movies2_ database.
. With `sudo`, create the directory */home/ubuntu/reports*.
. Change ownership of the reports directory to _neo4j_:  `sudo chown neo4j:neo4j /home/ubuntu/reports`
. Run the consistency check tool on *movies2* using `neo4j-admin` specifying *reports* as the directory where the report will be written. The consistency check tool should return the following:

image::L03-Ex5-Consistent.png[Ex5-Consistent,width=1000,align=center]

[start=6]
. Use `cypher-shell` to load the *movies.dump* data into a database named _movies3_.
. Use `cypher-shell` to create the _movies3_ database.
. Confirm that this database has 171 nodes.
. Stop the _movies3_ database.
. Next, you will "maliciously" corrupt the database. Modify the file *databases/movies3/neostore.nodestore.db* by adding some text to the file.

image::CorruptMovies3.png[CorruptMovies3,width=1000,align=center]

[start=11]
. Run the consistency check tool on *movieies3* using `neo4j-admin` specifying */home/ubuntu/reports* as the directory where the report will be written. The consistency check tool should return something like the following:

image::L03-Ex5-Inconsistent.png[Ex5-Inconsistent,width=1000,align=center]

[start=12]
. Use `cypher-shell` to drop the _movies3_ database.

==  *Exercise #8: Scripting changes to the database*

In this Exercise, you will gain experience scripting with `cypher-shell`. You will create four files in the */home/ubuntu/files* directory:

. *AddConstraintsMovies.cypher*
. *AddConstraintsMovies2.cypher*
. *AddConstraints.sh*
. *MaintainDB.sh*

=== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your EC2 instance for this course.
. Ensure that you are the user _neo4j_.
. Ensure that the Neo4j instance is started.

=== Exercise steps:

. Create a Cypher script in the */home/ubuntu/files* directory named *AddConstraintsMovies.cypher* with the following statements:
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (m:Movie) ASSERT m.title IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT p.name IS UNIQUE;
----

[start=6]
. Create a shell script in the */usr/local/work* directory named *AddConstraints.sh* that will forward *AddConstraints.cypher* to `cypher-shell`. This file should have the following contents:

----
cat /usr/local/work/AddConstraints.cypher | /usr/bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p training-helps --format verbose
----

[start=7]
. Create a shell script in the */usr/local/work* directory named *MaintainDB.sh* that will initialize the log file and then call *AddConstraints.sh*. This file should have the following contents:

----
rm -rf /usr/local/work/MaintainDB.log
/usr/local/work/AddConstraints.sh 2>&1 >> /usr/local/work/MaintainDB.log
----

[start=8]
. Ensure that the scripts you created have execute permissions.
. Run the *MaintainDB.sh* script and  view the log file.

[start=10]
. Confirm that it created the constraints in the database. (Check using cypher-shell (`CALL db.constraints();`))
