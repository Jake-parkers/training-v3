= Exercise #7: Checking consistency of a database
// for local preview
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

In this Exercise, you check the consistency of a database that is consistent. Then you modify a file that causes the database to become corrupt and then check its consistency.

== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your EC2 instance for this course.
. Ensure that you are the user _neo4j_.
. Ensure that the Neo4j instance is started.

== Exercise steps:

. Use `cypher-shell` to load the *movies.dump* data into a database named _movies2_.
. Use `cypher-shell` to create the _movies2_ database.
. Confirm that this database has 171 nodes.
. Stop the _movies2_ database.
. With `sudo`, create the directory */home/ubuntu/reports*.
. Change ownership of the reports directory to _neo4j_:  `sudo chown neo4j:neo4j /home/ubuntu/reports`
. Run the consistency check tool on *movies2* using `neo4j-admin` specifying *reports* as the directory where the report will be written. The consistency check tool should return the following:
+

. Use `cypher-shell` to load the *movies.dump* data into a database named _movies3_.
. Use `cypher-shell` to create the _movies3_ database.
. Confirm that this database has 171 nodes.
. Stop the _movies3_ database.
. Next, you will "maliciously" corrupt the database. Modify the file *databases/movies3/neostore.nodestore.db* by adding some text to the file.

. Run the consistency check tool on *movies3* using `neo4j-admin` specifying */home/ubuntu/reports* as the directory where the report will be written. The consistency check tool should return something like the following:
+

. Use `cypher-shell` to drop the _movies3_ database.

== Exercise summary

You have now you checked the consistency of a database that is consistent. Then you modified a file that causes the database to become corrupt and then checked its consistency.
