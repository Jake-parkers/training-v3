== *Exercise #11: Managing backups*

In this Exercise, you will perform an online backup of a database where you use the same host for the backup process.
Then you will modify the database.
Finally, you will restore the database from the backup to see that it was successfully restored.

[NOTE]
In your real application, if you were to back up a production stand-alone Neo4j instance, you would use a different host from the host that is running the Neo4j instance.

=== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your EC2 instance for this course.
. Ensure that you are the user _neo4j_.

=== Exercise steps:

. Modify the Neo4j configuration so that online backup is enabled and will be done on this same host.
For example, your *neo4j.conf* file should look something like this:

----

----

[start=3]
. Restart the Neo4j instance.
. Create a directory named */usr/local/backup* and ensure that it is owned by _neo4j:neo4j_.

ifdef::backend-pdf[]
// force page break
<<<
endif::backend-pdf[]

[start=5]
. Perform an online backup of the active database (*movie3.db*).
The result of the backup should look something like this:

image::L03-Ex9-Backup2.png[Ex9-Backup2,width=1000,align=center]

[start=6]
. Stop the Neo4j instance.
. Corrupt the database like you did earlier in this module. Modify the file *movie3.db/neostore.nodestore.db* by adding some text to the file.
. Run the consistency check tool on *movie3.db* using `neo4j-admin` specifying */usr/local/work/reports* as the directory where the report will be written.

----
 neo4j-admin check-consistency --database=movie3.db --report-dir=/usr/local/reports --verbose=true
----

[start=9]
. The consistency check tool should return that inconsistencies were found.

ifdef::backend-pdf[]
// force page break
<<<
endif::backend-pdf[]

[start=10]
. Restore the *movie3.db* database from the backup.
. Check its consistency.

[start=11]
. Confirm that the Neo4j instance starts without error.

=== Exercise summary

You have now configured and tested changes to the HTTP port and whether the Neo4j instance can be accessed from an external client..
