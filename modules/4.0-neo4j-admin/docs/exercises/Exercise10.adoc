= Exercise #10: Modify the HTTP port
// for local preview
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

In this Exercise, will modify the HTTP used by your instance. How you change the HTTP port will depend on your host OS.
On OS X, the port forwarding is not as clean as on Debian so to set up a Docker Neo4j instance that uses a different HTTP port, you must create a new instance.


== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your Docker Neo4j instance for this course.

== Exercise steps (EC2 instance)

. Connect to the instance with cypher-shell.
. Call the procedure to list the entire configuration for the instance.
+
image::listConfigDocker.png[listConfigDocker,width=800,align=center]

. Call the procedure to list all properties that have "http" in them.
+

image::listConfigDockerhttp.png[listConfigDockerhttp,width=800,align=center]

. Change the configuration for the HTTP port to a value that is not in use on your system, for example *9999*.
+
image::changehttp.png[changehttp,width=800,align=center]

. Restart the Docker Neo4j instance.
. With cypher-shell, confirm that the dbms.connector.http.listen_address value is 9999 using  dbms.listConfig().
+

. Enter this in a terminal window to confirm that you can access using the HTTP API the Neo4j instance using the 9999 port number:
+

----
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "statements" : [ { "statement"  : "CALL db.schema.visualization()" }]}' http://localhost:9999/db/data/transaction/commit -u neo4j
----

You must specify the password for the Neo4j instance.
You should see something like the following:

[start=8]
. Change the configuration back to using the default HTTP port of 7474.
. Restart the Neo4j instance.

== Exercise steps (OS X)

. Create a directory *$HOME/docker-neo4j/testhttp*. You will be creating a new container that uses this directory, rather than *neo4j*.
. Stop the Docker Neo4j instance.
. Copy the *create_neo4j_instance.sh* to *create_neo4j_instance_http.sh*.
. Modify *create_neo4j_instance_http.sh* so that it uses the directory *testhttp* rather than *neo4j*.
. Modify the port mapping for 7474 to be 9999.
+

. Run the script to create and start the instance.
. Confirm the docker instance successfully started.
. View the log for the instance.
+

image::LogInstancePort9999.png[LogInstancePort9999,width=1200,align=center]

. Stop the testhttp Docker Neo4j instance.
. Start the testhttp Docker Neo4j instance.
. Connect to the instance with cypher-shell. You will need to change the password since this is a new Neo4j instance.
+

image::cypher-shell-testhttp.png[cypher-shell-testhttp,width=1200,align=center]

. Call the procedure to list the entire configuration for the instance.
+
image::listConfigDocker.png[listConfigDocker,width=800,align=center]

. Call the procedure to list all properties that have "http" in them.
+

image::ListConfig-testhttp.png[ListConfig-testhttp,width=800,align=center]

. In a Web browser, access the server  using port 9999.
+

image::WebBrowser-testhttp.png[WebBrowser-testhttp,width=800,align=center]

. Stop the testhttp Docker Neo4j instance.

== Exercise summary

You have now configured and tested changes to the HTTP port and whether the Neo4j instance can be accessed from a different HTTP port.
