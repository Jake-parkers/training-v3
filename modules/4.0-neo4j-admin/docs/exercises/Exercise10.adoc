== Exercise #10: Modify the HTTP port
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../images]

In this Exercise, will modify the HTTP used by your instance to allow external connections.
Then you will modify the configuration to use a different port for HTTP connections.

=== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your EC2 instance for this course.
. Ensure that you are the user _neo4j_.

=== Exercise steps:

. Determine the public IP address for your EC2 instance for this course.
----
curl ifconfig.me
----

[start=2]
. On your local system, open a Web browser and go to  <address returned by ifconfig.me>:7474. You should not be able to access the Neo4j instance. This is because you have not opened up the server for external access.
. Change the configuration to allow external connections to the default HTTP port 7474.
----
dbms.connectors.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0
----
[start=4]
. Restart the Neo4j instance.
. Try accessing <address returned by ifconfig.me>:7474. Is it attempting to connect?
. Enter the credentials for your Neo4j instance. You should now be connected.

. Next, change the configuration for the HTTP port to a value that is not in use on your system, for example *9999*.
. Restart the Neo4j instance.
. Can you access the Neo4j instance using port 9999 as you did previously from an external system using a Web browser? You should not be able to. This is not a Neo4j configuration issue, but rather an EC2 instance limitation where the EC2 instance has only allowed access to port 7474 from other systems.
. Enter this in a EC2 terminal window to confirm that you can access using the HTTP API the Neo4j instance using the 9999 port number:

----
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "statements" : [ { "statement"  : "CALL db.schema.visualization()" }]}' http://localhost:9999/db/data/transaction/commit -u neo4j
----

You must specify the password for the Neo4j instance.
You should see something like the following:

[start=11]
. Change the configuration back to using the default HTTP port of 7474.
. Restart the Neo4j instance.


=== Exercise summary

You have now configured and tested changes to the HTTP port and whether the Neo4j instance can be accessed from an external client..
