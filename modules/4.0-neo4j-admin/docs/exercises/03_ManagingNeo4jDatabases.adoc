== *Exercise #2: Managing the Neo4j instance*

In this Exercise, you will stop and start the Neo4j instance and view its status and log file using the Debian installation you verified in the previous exercise.

=== Exercise steps:

. Open a terminal on your system and connect to your EC2 instance.
. View the status of the _neo4j_ service:

----
systemctl status neo4j
----

You should see something like this:

image::Status-Debian.png[Status-Debian,width=600,align=center]

[start=3]
. Create the */var/run/neo4j* directory and make sure it is owned by *neo4j*
----
sudo mkdir /var/run/neo4j
sudo chown neo4j:neo4j /var/run/neo4j
----

image::add_var_run_neo4j.png[add_var_run_neo4j,width=600,align=center]

[start=4]
. Disable the _neo4j_ service:
----
sudo systemctl disable neo4j
----

image::disable_neo4j_service.png[disable_neo4j_service,width=600,align=center]

[start=5]
. View the status of the Neo4j instance.
----
systemctl status neo4j
----

image::neo4j_status_service_disabled.png[neo4j_status_service_disabled,width=600,align=center]

[start=6]
. Start the Neo4j instance.

----
sudo systemctl start neo4j
----

[start=7]
. View the status of the Neo4j instance.

image::Neo4j_started.png[Neo4j_started,width=600,align=center]

[start=8]
. Stop the Neo4j instance and then view its status.

----
sudo systemctl stop neo4j
systemctl status neo4j
----
image::Stop_neo4j.png[Stop_neo4j,width=600,align=center]

[start=9]
. Examine the end of the Neo4j log file.

----
journalctl -e -u neo4j
----

image::JournalEnd.png[JournalEnd,width=600,align=center]

[start=10]
. Examine the database folders created for this Neo4j instance.

image::DataFiles.png[DataFiles,width=600,align=center]

[start=11]
. Examine the log files for this Neo4j instance.

image::ViewLogFiles.png[ViewLogFiles,width=600,align=center]

=== Exercise summary

You have now gained experience starting and stopping a Neo4j instance as well as viewing its status and the log file for the instance.

== *Exercise #3: Using `cypher-shell`*

In this Exercise, you will log in to the Neo4j instance with `cypher-shell`, change the password for the Neo4j instance, and use both the system and user database.

=== Before you begin

* Make sure you have a terminal window open to your EC2 instance for this course.
* Ensure that the Neo4j instance is started.

=== Exercise steps:

. Log into the database with `cypher-shell` using the default credentials of _neo4j/neo4j_.
    *Hint*: Type:  `/usr/bin/cypher-shell`.
[start=2]
. Enter a new password that you will remember.
. Exit out of `cypher-shell`.
. Start a `cypher-shell` session providing the -u and -p arguments.
. Use the system database to view all databases served by this Neo4j instance.
image::ShowInitialDatabases.png[ShowInitialDatabases,width=1000,align=center]
[start=6]
. Use the _neo4j_ database and enter this Cypher statement:
  `CREATE (:Person {name: '<your name'})'`
[start=7]
. Enter this Cypher statement to retrieve the node you just created:
----
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p;
----
[start=8]
. Enter this Cypher statement to delete the node you just created:
----
MATCH (p:Person) DELETE p;
----
[start=9]
. Create the directory, _files_ in your home directory.
----
cd
mkdir files
----
[start=10]
. Download this file: https://data.neo4j.com/admin-neo4j/movieDB.cypher to the _files_ directory. This file contains the Cypher statements to load the database with movie data.
----
cd files
curl -O https://data.neo4j.com/admin-neo4j/movieDB.cypher
----
[start=11]
. Invoke `cypher-shell` using *movieDB.cypher* as input.
. Start `cypher-shell` and execute these statements to confirm that the data was loaded into the user database:
----
CALL db.schema.visualization();
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks' RETURN p;
----

You should see something like this:
image::ConfirmMovieData.png[ConfirmMovieData,width=1000,align=center]

[start=13]
. Exit `cypher-shell`.

=== Exercise summary

You have now successfully started a `cypher-shell` client session that connects to the Neo4j instance.
You typically use `cypher-shell` to execute Cypher against a user database, but you can also use it to perform some management tasks against the Neo4j instance by accessing the system database.

== *Exercise #4: Adding and dropping a database*

In this exercise you will gain some experience with adding and dropping a database.

=== Before you begin

* Make sure you have a terminal window open to your EC2 instance for this course.
* Ensure that the Neo4j instance is started.

=== Exercise steps:

. Connect to the Neo4j instance with `cypher-shell`.
. Enter the command to show all databases.
    *Hint*: You must use the system database.
image::ShowDatabasesEx.png[ShowDatabasesEx,width=1000,align=center]
[start=3]
. Enter the command to create a database named _databaseone_.
. Enter the command to show all databases.
image::AddDatabaseOne.png[AddDatabaseOne,width=1000,align=center]
[start=5]
. Exit `cypher-shell`.
. View the folders where the databases are located for this instance.
image::AddDatabaseOneFiles.png[AddDatabaseOneFiles,width=1000,align=center]
[start=7]
. Modify the *neo4j.conf* file to use _databaseone_ as the default database.

*Hint*: In the terminal window:
----
sudo vi /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
Type "i" to enter input mode.
Uncomment the dbms.default.database property.
Replace neo4j with databaseone.
Press ESC to get out of input mode.
Type ":w" to write the changes to the file.
Type ":q"
----
[start=8]
. Restart the Neo4j instance.
----
sudo systemctl restart neo4j
----
[start=9]
. Connect to the Neo4j instance with `cypher-shell`.
. Enter the command to show all databases.
. Drop the database _neo4j_.
. Enter the command to show all databases.
image::RemovedNeo4j.png[RemovedNeo4j,width=1000,align=center]
[start=13]
. Exit `cypher-shell`.

=== Exercise summary

You have now successfully added and dropped a database, as well as specifying a different database as the default database for clients.

== *Exercise #5: Copying databases*

In this exercise, you will use `neo4j-admin` to copy a database and create a database from a dump file.

=== Before you begin

* Make sure you have two terminal windows open to your EC2 instance for this course.
* Ensure that the Neo4j instance is started.

=== Exercise steps

*Part 1*: First you will create a movies database that will be used in this exercise for copying.

. In `cypher-shell` create a database named _movies_.
. Exit out of `cypher-shell`.
. Invoke `cypher-shell` using *movieDB.cypher* as input and specify _movies_ as the database.
----
/usr/bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p training-helps --database movies < ~/files/movieDB.cypher
----
[start=4]
. In `cypher-shell` confirm that the database was loaded. It should contain 171 nodes:
----
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
----

*Part 2*: You will make a copy of the _movies_ database, _movies2_ for local use in the Neo4j instance.

. In `cypher-shell` stop the _movies_ database.
. Exit `cypher-shell`.
. In a different terminal window, enter this:
----
sudo /usr/bin/neo4j-admin copy --from-database=movies --to-database=movies2
----
[start=5]
. Change the ownership to neo4j:neo4j recursively for the sub-folder for _movies2_ under the *databases* and *transactions*
folders, for example:
----
sudo chown -R neo4j:neo4j /var/lib/neo4j/data/databases/movies2
sudo chown -R neo4j:neo4j /var/lib/neo4j/data/transactions/movies2
----
[start=6]
. Restart the Neo4j instance.
. In `cypher-shell' create _movies2_.
. Confirm that this _movies2_ database has 171 nodes.
----
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
----

*Part 3*: You will dump the _movies_ database.

. Use the `dump` command of the `neo4j-admin` tool to create the dump file as follows:
----
sudo /usr/bin/neo4j-admin dump --database=movies --to=/home/ubuntu/files/movies.dump
----
[start=2]
. Confirm that the *movies.dump* file was created.

*Part 4*: You use the dump file to create a database.

. Use the `load` command of the `neo4j-admin` tool to create the database, _movies3_ from the dump file as follows:
----
sudo /usr/bin/neo4j-admin load --database=movies3 --from=home/ubuntu/files/movies.dump
----
[start=2]
. Change the ownership to neo4j:neo4j recursively for the sub-folder for _movies3_ under the databases and transactions folders, for example:
----
sudo chown -R neo4j:neo4j /var/lib/neo4j/data/databases/movies3
sudo chown -R neo4j:neo4j /var/lib/neo4j/data/transactions/movies3
----
[start=3]
. Restart the Neo4j instance.
. In `cypher-shell' create _movies3_.
. Confirm that this _movies3_ database has 171 nodes.

=== Exercise summary

You have now gained experience copying a database within the Neo4j instance and also creating a dump file that can be used to create a database on a different system.
