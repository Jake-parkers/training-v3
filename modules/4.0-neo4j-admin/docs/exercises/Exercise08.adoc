In this Exercise, you will gain experience scripting with `cypher-shell`. You will create four files in the */home/ubuntu/files* directory:

. *AddConstraintsMovies.cypher*
. *AddConstraintsMovies2.cypher*
. *AddConstraints.sh*
. *MaintainDB.sh*

=== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your EC2 instance for this course.
. Ensure that you are the user _neo4j_.
. Ensure that the Neo4j instance is started.

=== Exercise steps:

. Create a Cypher script in the */home/ubuntu/files* directory named *AddConstraintsMovies.cypher* with the following statements:
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT TitleConstraint ON (m:Movie) ASSERT m.title IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT NameConstraint ON (p:Person) ASSERT p.name IS UNIQUE;
----

[start=6]
. Create a shell script in the */home/ubuntu/files* directory named *AddConstraints.sh* that will forward *AddConstraints.cypher* to `cypher-shell`. This file should have the following contents:

----
cat /home/ubuntu/files/AddConstraintsMovies.cypher | /usr/bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <Neo4j instance password>  --format verbose
----

[start=7]
. Create a shell script in the */home/ubuntu/files* directory named *MaintainDB.sh* that will initialize the log file and then call *AddConstraints.sh*. This file should have the following contents:

----
rm -rf /home/ubuntu/reports/MaintainDB.log
/home/ubuntu/files/AddConstraints.sh 2>&1 >> /home/ubuntu/reports/MaintainDB.log
----

[start=8]
. Ensure that the scripts you created have execute permissions.
. Run the *MaintainDB.sh* script and  view the log file.

[start=10]
. Confirm that it created the constraints in the default database (_maindb_). (Check using cypher-shell (`CALL db.constraints();`))

=== Exercise summary

You have now written some shell scripts to manage a database.
