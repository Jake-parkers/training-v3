:module-next-title: Building the Initial Graph Data Model

== About this module

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Describe what graph data modeling is.
* Describe how Neo4j supports graph data modeling.
* Describe the tools you can use for graph data modeling.
* Describe the workflow for graph data modeling.

== What is graph data modeling?

Graph data modeling is a Collaborative effort where the application domain is analyzed by stakeholders and developers to come up with the optimal model for use with Neo4j.
Stakeholders must understand the domain and be prepared to ask detailed questions about how the business-at-hand operates.

Stakeholders are:

* Business analysts
* Architects
* Managers
* Project leaders

== How does Neo4j support graph data modeling?

* Neo4j is a full-featured graph database that allows you to create *property graphs*.
* Applications retrieve data for business use cases by *traversing the graph*.

On this slide, do a Concept Check.

Ask questions like:

. What information can be attached to a node?  Which of these are required?
.. Labels & properties.  None required
. What information can be attached to a relationship?  Which of these are required?
.. Direction, type, and properties.  Direction and type are required.
. What is the difference between a label and property?
.. Labels are categorical.  Properties are specific.

Nodes and relationships are the key components of a graph.
Nodes should have labels to categorize entities.
Relationships must have direction and type.
Nodes and relationships can have properties.
A label is used to categorize a set of nodes.
Properties are used to provide specific values to a node or relatiobship.

=== Traversal in the graph

MATCH (r:Residence)<-[:OWNS]-(p:Person)
WHERE r.address = '475 Broad Street'
RETURN p

Traversal means anchoring a query based upon a property, then traversing the graph to satisfy the query.
In this example, the address property of the Residence node is used to determine where to anchor the query.
Then, the _OWNS_ relationship is traversed to retrieve the qualifying nodes.
A relationship is only traversed once in a query.

Ask the students these questions:
. What uniqueness limitations does Cypher enforce?
.. A query can visit a node any number of times,  but can traverse each relationship only once.
. Given a Cypher query, how does Neo4j decide where to begin traversing?
.. Neo4j will predict which of the node sets in the query is smallest.  It will begin there.  In this case, r is likely to be smallest, as it has a property filter.

== Tools for graph data modeling

[.notes]

There are many ways that developers and stakeholders can work together to build a graph data model for their application.
Drawing it on a whiteboard may be done initially, but you will need to share your model with others so using a tool is recommended.
The tool that we use in this course is the Arrow tool which integrates with Neo4j.
With the Arrow tool, you can generate Cypher statements for creating code to implement the model.

== Workflow for graph data modeling

[.notes]
--
Data model maintenance is cyclical and iterative.
We are comfortable with this idea because updating a graph model is much cheaper and easier than updating the schema of a tabular store.
Ease-of-updating will be a consistent theme throughout this training.
