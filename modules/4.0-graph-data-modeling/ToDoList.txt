Next version of Arrow Tool video:

0:10--slight misspeak. "ACP jones" rather than "APC jones"

0:15--Arrows frequently does not initialize with a blank node.  I would start from an empty screen, because adding an extra node is easier to follow and fix than not having one and being unsure of how to start.
