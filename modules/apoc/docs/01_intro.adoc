== About this module

[.notes]
--
Neo4j enables developers to create applications that are best architected as graph-powered systems that are built upon the rich connectedness of data.

== How do we learn APOC?


* Massively hands-on, lots of exercises
* Help each other!
* Ask questions as they arise.
* Datasets: Movie graph, StackOverflow
* Have the APOC docs open
* Bring your own "How do I?"

== Questions for you

Have you:

* Used built-in procedures in Neo4j?
* Installed and used APOC?
* Used other procedure libraries?
    ** Graph Algorithms, GraphAware NLP, Spatial?
* Written your own procedures/functions?
* Deployed your procedures/functions to production?
* Contributed to APOC or other procedure libraries?

== Extending Neo4j

[.is-half.left]
--
User-defined procedures let you write custom code that:

* Is written in any JVM language
* Accesses the Neo4j Java API
* Is deployed to the database server
* Can be accessed by applications via Cypher

== A history of APOC

* Started life as Michael Hunger's “Fun Project”
* 3.0 was about to have User-defined procedures callable from Cypher but was missing many utility procedures.
* APOC added them and quickly grew from 50 to 150 to 450 procedures & functions
* It's an active OSS project
* It has many contributors and users (100k downloads)

== Path Expansion

== Path Expansion

Customized path expansion from start node(s)

* Min/max traversals
* Limit number of results
* Optional (no rows removed if no results, if set to true)
* Choice of BFS/DFS expansion
* Custom uniqueness (restrictions on visitations of nodes/rels)
* Relationship and label filtering
* No property filtering/evaluation

== Expander procedures: apoc.path.*

[.small]
.The original, when you don’t need much customization
[source,cypher]
----
expand(startNode(s), relationshipFilter, labelFilter, minLevel, maxLevel) YIELD path
----

[.small]
.Most flexible, rich configuration map
[source,cypher]
----
expandConfig(startNode(s), configMap) YIELD path
----

[.small]
.Only distinct nodes, don't care about paths
[source,cypher]
----
subgraphNodes(startNode(s), configMap) YIELD node
----

[.small]
.Only one distinct path to each node
[source,cypher]
----
spanningTree(startNode(s), configMap) YIELD path
----

[.small]
.Only distinct nodes and all rels between them
[source,cypher]
----
subgraphAll(startNode(s), configMap) YIELD nodes, relationships
----

[.small]
https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/current/graph-querying/path-expander/

== Config map values

* minLevel: int
* maxLevel: int
* relationshipFilter: string
* labelFilter: string
* uniqueness: string (‘RELATIONSHIP_PATH’, ’NODE_GLOBAL’, ‘NODE_PATH’, etc)
* bfs: boolean,
* filterStartNode: boolean
* limit: int
* optional: boolean
* endNodes: [nodes]
* terminatorNodes: [nodes]
* whitelistNodes: [nodes]
* blacklistNodes: [nodes]
* sequence: string
* beginSequenceAtStart: boolean

== Relationship filter

Which relationships (type and direction) to follow:

* '<ACTED_IN' - Incoming Rel
* 'DIRECTED>' - Outgoing Rel
* 'REVIEWED' - Any direction
* ‘>’ - Direction, any type
* '<ACTED_IN | DIRECTED> | REVIEWED' - Multiple, in varied direction

== Label filter

What is/isn't allowed during expansion, and what is/isn't returned:

* '-Director' – Blacklist, not allowed in path
* '+Person' – Whitelist , only allowed in path (+ symbol optional)
  **    (no whitelist = all allowed)
* '>Reviewer' – End node, only return these, and continue expansion past them
* '/Producer' – Terminator node, only return these, stop expansion
* 'Person|Movie|-Director|>Reviewer|/Producer' – Combine them

== Sequences

* Repeating sequences of relationships, labels, or both.
* Uses labelFilter and relationshipFilter, just add commas
* Or use sequence for both together

labelFilter:'Post | -Blocked, Reply, >Admin'
(use beginSequenceAtStart:false if sequence begins at one hop from start node)

relationshipFilter:'NEXT>,<FROM,POSTED>|REPLIED>'

sequence:'Post |-Blocked, NEXT>, Reply, <FROM, >Admin, POSTED>| REPLIED>'

== End nodes/terminator nodes

What if we already have the nodes that should end the expansion?

* `endNodes` – like filter, but takes a collection of nodes (or ids)
* `terminatorNodes` – like filter (stop expand), but also takes a collection (whitelistNodes and blacklistNodes too!)
* Can be used with labelFilter or sequence, but continue or include must be unanimous.

== Example: Get connected nodes

== Task: Get closest Reviewers

Switch back to the default database and add `Reviewer` labels:

WHERE (rev)-[:REVIEWED]->()
SET rev:Reviewer
----

[.small]
--
. Can you write a query to find if there’s a :Reviewer node within 5 hops of Christian Bale?
  ** Start with the Cypher query
  ** Then rewrite using the path expander procedure

. Write a query to match to 5 random :Persons, then get the 2 closest :Reviewers for each person
  ** Start with the path expander procedure
  ** What difficulties would you have doing this with just Cypher?
