== Similarity algorithms

Similarity algorithms evaluate how alike nodes are at an individual level either based on node attributes, neighboring nodes, or relationship properties.

Product supported:

[square]
* Node Similarity (Jaccard Index)

Labs implementations:

[square]
* Cosine Similarity

* Euclidean Similarity

* Overlap Similarity

* Pearson Similarity

* Approximate Nearest Neighbors

== Node Similarity algorithm

Node Similarity algorithm computes similarities between pairs of nodes based on the Jaccard Similarity Score.
Two nodes are considered similar if they share many of the same neighbors.
The input of this algorithm is usually a bipartite graph containing two disjoint node sets.
The Node Similarity algorithm compares all nodes from the first node set based on their relationships to nodes in the second set.
The output of the algorithm is a unipartite network between nodes in the first node set.
We can think of this process as translating indirect relationships to direct ones.

Mathematically, Jaccard Similarity Score is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two sets.

For example, if set A contains {Orange, Banana, Cherry, Pineapple}  and set B contains {Orange, Banana, Apple} then the Jaccard algorithm counts 2 co-occurrences {Orange, Banana} and divides that count by the number of items in A and B (while not double-counting items), in this case 5 {Orange, Banana, Apple, Cherry, Pineapple}.
The resulting Jaccard similarity coefficient is 2/5 which is 0.4. 
A coefficient of 1 indicates that the compared sets are identical.

Here is why you use Node Similarity:
* Find recommendations of similar items.

* First step of analyzing a bipartite network.

* Part of link prediction analysis.

Show the students the basics of using NEuler and have them do the same on their systems:

. Let's look at how to use the Jaccard Similarity algorithm in NEuler to create a jaccard value for each node which indicates how many nodes are connected to the same nodes.
. We select the Similarity group of algorithms.
. Then we select the Jaccard algorithm.
. Let's select the *Any* label and *HAS_TAG* relationship type.
. We leave the remaining default settings.
. Then we run the algorithm.
. Here are the table results.
. We return to the configuration to edit it.
. We modify the last configuration to use *REVERSE* direction.
. We run the algorithm.
. Here are the table results. Here we note that the relationship direction is crutial as it will compare question or tags, depending on the relationship direction.
. And here we see the generated code.
. Finally, we can copy the generated Browser Guide to Neo4j Browser.
. This concludes our look at using the the Jaccard Similarity algorithm in NEuler to create a jaccard value for each node which indicates how many nodes are connected to the same nodes.
