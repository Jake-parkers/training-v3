:module-next-title: Overview of Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are used to compute metrics for graphs, nodes, or relationships.
They can provide insights on relevant entities (centralities, ranking) in the graph or inherent structures such as communities (community-detection, graph-partitioning, clustering).
In this course you will learn how to use Neo4j's Graph Data Science library to enhance your graph-based applications that require analysis.
