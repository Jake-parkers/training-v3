== Preparing your development environment

To prepare your development environment you must:

. Set up Neo4j Desktop on your system.
. Install the APOC and GDSL plugin libraries for your database.
. Install the Graph Data Science Playground (NEuler).
. Start the database and the Graph Data Science Playground.
. Load some data into your database you will use for the hands-on exercises.

== Step 1: Set up Neo4j Desktop on your system

To perform the exercises of this course you must have downloaded and installed Neo4j Desktop on your system.

ifdef::backend-html5,backend-pdf[]
These videos show how to install and get started using Neo4j Desktop.
For your environment you should:

. Download the latest version of Neo4j Desktop.
. Create a project in Neo4j Desktop named *Graph Algos*.
. Create a local 4.1.x database in this Graph Algos project.

== Step 2: Install APOC and GDSL for your database

. Click the *Manage* area for the database.
. Select the *Plugins* tab.
. Install the *APOC* plugin.
. Install the *Graph Data Science* plugin.

== Step 3: Install Graph Data Science Playground (NEuler)

image::enter-neuler.png[local and global graph analytics,width=500, align=center]

NEuler is a project of Neo4j Labs and is an excellent way to explore smaller graphs.


. Open the *Graph Apps* pane in the left panel.
. Double-click *Graph Apps Gallery*, a new window opens.
. Click the link for the Graph Data Science Playground install as shown here:

image::GDSPlaygroundInstall.jpg[Graph Data Science Playground Install,width=500, align=center]

[start=4]
. A new browser tab should open for this address.
. Copy this address to your clipboard. It should be: https://neo.jfrog.io/neo/api/npm/npm/neuler.
. In the left *Graph Apps* panel, paste this address in the *Install* field at the bottom.
. Click *Install*.
. The *Graph Data Science Graph Playground* Graph App should now appear in the left pane.

== Datasets you will use in this course

=== Game of Thrones

image::got.png[Game of Thrones,width=500, align=center]

The INTERACTS_SEASONx relationship has a property, weight to indicate the number of interactions.

The Character node has two properties, name and id where id is the capitalized value of name.

=== European Roads

The Place node has multiple properties, name and countryCode.

The EROAD relationship has four properties, distance, inverse_distance, road_number, and watercrossing.

=== Recipes

image::recipe.png[recipe,width=500, align=center]

This is a very simple data model where each node has only a name and there are no properties in the relationships.

== Step 4: Start the database and Graph Data Science Playground

. In Neo4j Desktop, start the database.
. Start the *Graph Data Science Graph Playground* Graph App:
.. Double-click *Graph Data Science Graph Playground*  app in the left pane to start it.
.. Once started, it should open a new window as follows:

== Step 5: Load the data for the exercises

Open Neo4j Browser for the started database.
In the query edit pane of Neo4j Browser, execute the browser command:

kbd:[:4.0-intro-graph-algos-exercises]

and follow the instructions for *Load the Data for the Exercises*.

[NOTE]
This exercise has 4 steps.
Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes.
