== Community Detection algorithms

Community detection algorithms are designed to help us discover and understand the structure of complex networks.
Understanding the community structure has many real-world applications in sociology, biology, and computer science.
We think of a community as a densely-connected group of nodes, similar to how a group of friends is highly interconnected.

These algorithms are supported:

[square]
* Weakly Connected Components (unionFind)

* Label Propagation

* Louvain Modularity

* Triangle Counting

* Local Clustering Coefficient

These algorithms are are in alpha (labs):

[square]
* Strongly Connected Components

* K-1 Coloring

* Modularity optimization.

== Weakly Connected Components

The Weakly Connected Components (WCC) algorithm is used to find disconnected subgraphs or islands within our network.
In a single connected component, each node can reach all other nodes when disregarding relationships' direction, effectively treating the connections as undirected.
Understanding how many connected components exist in our network is crucial to understanding the graph structure.
For that reason, the WCC algorithm is often used early in graph analysis.
A best practice is to run WCC to test whether a graph is connected as a preparatory step for all other graph algorithms.
Performing this quick test can avoid accidentally running algorithms on only one disconnected component of a graph and getting incorrect results.
It can also help you to better comprehend results from other algorithms.

Here is why you use WCC:

[square]
* Early step in graph analysis to see how a graph is structured.

* Great tool to use for graphs that are being updated frequently since it scales well.

* Can help detect new nodes in common that could trigger investigation.

Here are some examples:

[square]
* Keeping track of clusters of database records as part of the deduplication process of MDM.

* Working with Citation networks.

Show the students the basics of using NEuler and have them do the same on their systems:

. Let's look at how to use the Connected Component algorithm in NEuler to discover how specific types of nodes are connected in the graph, regardless of the direction of their relationhips.
. Since we previously added more nodes and relationships to the database, we must refresh NEuler to ensure that all nodes are known.
. We select the Community detection group of algorithms.
. Then we select the Connected components algorithm.
. We want to discover how Person nodes are related to each other using the HELPS relationship. We select the *Person* label and *HELPS* relationship type.
. We leave the Store results box checked as well as the other default values. Here the default value for the number of nodes per community is 10 which is fine for our small dataset.
. Now we run the algorithm.
. Here are the table results.
. In the visualization, we see that all nodes have a community value of 0 because they are all in the same undirected group.
. Here is the generated code. It has the parameter settings, the call to the algorithm, and Cypher code to retrieve the nodes.
. You can also use the generated code for the named graph, in cases where you want to save intermediate graphs for further downstream processing in your workflow.
. In NEuler, you can copy the generated code from NEuler to Neo4j Browser as a Browser Guide.
. When we play this Browser Guide, we can repeat the same code and you can use this code as part of your application logic.
. In the graph retrieved by the generated code, here, we see that all nodes are reachable, regardless of direction to each other. All nodes receive the community value of 0 because they are all in the same connected group.
. Additionally, in NEuler, if you return to the configuration for an algorithm, it shows the last configuration that was used.
. You can click Edit configuration if you want to make changes to rerun the algorithm.
. If you want to clear the configuration and start again with the defaults, simply click another algorithm and then go back to the algorithm where you will see the default values again.
. This concludes our look at running the Connected Component algorithm in NEuler.

== Label Propagation

The Label Propagation algorithm (LPA) is a fast algorithm for describing communities in a graph.
It detects these groups using network topology alone and does not require any prior information about the communities or their structure.
In the LPA, the nodes select their community based on their direct neighbors using the node labels.
In addition, weights on nodes and relationships can also be considered.
The idea is that a single label can quickly become dominant in a densely-connected group of nodes, but it will have trouble crossing a sparsely connected region.

image::label-propagation-explanation.png[Label propagation explanation,width=500, align=center]

Here is how the Label Propagation algorithm works.
First, every node is initialized with a property.
By default, the initial property is unique for every node.
However, the LPA also lends itself well to semi-supervised learning because you can seed the initial properties with pre-assigned node labels that you know are predictive.

In this example, we have started with 2 *A* nodes, but left all other's unique.
We are using the node default weights of 1.
Nodes are then processed randomly, with each node acquiring its neighbor's label with the maximum weight. 
So, in the first iteration, the left *A* acquires the label *F*, *B* acquires the label *D*, and *C* now becomes *A*.
The maximum weight is calculated based on the weights of neighbor nodes and their relationships.
In addition, ties are broken uniformly and randomly.
There will be times when a label is not updated because the neighbor with the maximum weight has the same label.
Iterations continue until each node has the majority label of its neighbors or reached the maximum iteration limit.
A maximum iteration limit will prevent endless cycles where the algorithm cannot converge on a solution, essentially getting caught in a flip-flop cycle for some labels.
In contrast to other algorithms, LPA can return different community structures when run multiple times on the same graph.
The order in which LPA evaluates nodes can influence the final communities it returns.
Another factor is the random tie-breaking process.

Here is why you use LPA:

[square]
* Large-scale networks for initial clustering.

* Great for preprocessing data (classification).

* Where groupings are less clear but weights can be used.

* Can be run with concurrent threads for extremely fast graph partitioning and scales nearly linearly.

Here are some examples:

[square]
* Assigning polarity of tweets as a part of semantic analysis. In this scenario, positive and negative seed labels from a classifier are used in combination with the Twitter follower graph.
//?? For more information, see Twitter polarity classification with label propagation over lexical links and the follower graph 14.

* Finding potentially dangerous combinations of possible co-prescribed drugs, based on the chemical similarity and side effect profiles. This study is found in 14 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2140465.

* Label Propagation Prediction of Drug-Drug Interactions Based on Clinical Side Effects.

* Inferring dialogue features and user intention for a machine learning model.

== Louvain Modularity

The Louvain Modularity algorithm is used to detect communities in large networks.
You can think of the algorithm doing a "what if" analysis to try out various groupings with the goal of eventually reaching a global modularity optimum. 

The Louvain modularity algorithm consists of repeated application of two steps.
The first step is a ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù assignment of nodes to communities, favoring local optimizations of modularity.
The modularity score quantifies the quality of an assignment of nodes to communities.
This process evaluates how much more densely connected the nodes within a community are, compared to how connected they would be in a random network.
It starts by calculating each change in modularity if that node joins and forms a community - for each of its immediate neighbors.
Then the node joins the node with the highest modularity change.
The process is repeated for each node with the above communities formed.
The second step is defining a new coarse-grained network, based on the communities found in the first step. 
These two steps are repeated until no further modularity-increasing reassignments of communities are possible.

image::louvain-modularity.png[Louvain Modularity,width=500, align=center]

In this example, we can see how the Louvain Modularity algorithm works.
First, the algorithm assigns nodes to communities by favoring local optimization of modularity.
In our case, the algorithm found four groups of nodes, which are indicated by node color.
In the second step, the algorithm merges each group of nodes into a single node.
The count of links between nodes within the same community and between various communities is now represented as a weighted relationship between the newly-merged nodes.
Once the new network is created, the whole process is repeated until a modularity maximum is reached.
The Louvain Modularity algorithm is interesting, because we can observe both the final as well as the intermediate communities that are calculated at the end of each level.
It is regarded as a hierarchical clustering algorithm because a hierarchy of communities is produced as a result.

Here is why you use Louvain:

* Community detection in large networks.

* Uncover hierarchical structures in data.

* Evaluate different grouping thresholds.

Here are some examples:

* Extracting topics from online social platforms, like Twitter and YouTube, based on the co-occurence of terms in documents as part of the topic modeling process.
//?? This approach is described in Topic Modeling based on Louvain method in Online Social Networks 20.

* Finding hierarchical community structures within the brain‚Äôs functional network, as described in Hierarchical Modularity in Human Brain Functional Networks 21.
//?? need a reference here?

* Evaluating criminal networks and holes in the structure.

* Detecting cyber attacks. The algorithm was used in a study of fast community detection in large scale cyber networks for cyber security applications 19. Once these communities have been detected they can be used to detect cyber attacks.

== Triangle Count

A triangle contains three nodes where each node has a connection to the other two.
In graph theory terminology, a triangle is equivalent to a 3-clique. 
The Triangle Count algorithm counts the number of triangles for each node in the graph.
It has gained popularity in social network analysis, where it is used to measure the cohesiveness and stability of networks.
It is also one of the indices used in the computation of the local clustering coefficients.
The Triangle Count algorithm in the GDS library only finds triangles in undirected graphs.

image::triangle-count.png[Triangle Count,width=500, align=center]

In this example, we count the number of triangles passing through node *U*.
In the left example, two triangles pass through node *U*.
The first triangle consists of node *U* and left-side nodes and the second triangle consists of node *U* and bottom-side nodes.
In the second example, we connect the top right nodes, which produces another triangle.

Here is why you use Triangle Count:

[square]
* Basic network analysis.

* Does the network exhibit small-world structures?

* Estimating stability.

* Finding structural holes.

* Scoring for machine learning.


Here are some examples:

[square]
* Identifying features for classifying a given website as spam content.
//?? This is described in Efficient Semi-streaming Algorithms for Local Triangle Counting in Massive Graphs 4.

* Investigating the community structure of Facebook‚Äôs social graph, where researchers found dense neighborhoods of users in an otherwise sparse global graph.
//?? Find this study in The Anatomy of the Facebook Social Graph 5.

* Exploring the thematic structure of the Web and detecting communities of pages with a common topics based on the reciprocal links between them.
//?? For more information, see Curvature of co-links uncovers hidden thematic layers in the World Wide Web 6.

== Local Clustering Coefficient

The Local Clustering Coefficient is the probability that neighbors of a particular node are connected to each other.
The goal of the Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm is to measure how tightly a group is clustered compared to how tightly it could be clustered.
The algorithm uses Triangle Count in its calculations, which provides a ratio of existing triangles to possible relationships.
A maximum value of 1 indicates a clique where every node is connected to every other node.

image::clustering-coefficient.png[Clustering Coefficient,width=500, align=center]

The Local Clustering Coefficient describes how many of the node's neighbors are also connected.
In the left example, the probability of node *U* neighbors being connected is 20%.
Node *U* has five neighbors.
If all the neighbors were connected to each other, that would be ten relationships between neighbors.
Because there are only two relationships between neighbors, the Local Clustering Coefficient is 0.2.
