== About this module

As a data scientist, you will create Neo4j Databases, add and update data in them, and query the data.
When you learn to use Neo4j as a data scientist, you have two options ‚éº  Neo4j Desktop or  Neo4j Sandbox.
In this course you will learn how to setup the Neo4j Desktop for use in the rest of the course, and connect to it from local Jupyter notebooks.

In this module, you will:
[square]
* Set up Neo4j Desktop on your system and create a database.
* Install APOC and GDSL for your database.
* Set up Jupyter Notebook on your system.
* Download the course notebooks.
* Launch a Jupyter Notebook and connect to the database.
* Launch a Jupyter Notebook to load the database.

== Step 1: Set up Neo4j Desktop on your system

To perform the exercises of this course you must have downloaded and installed Neo4j Desktop on your system.

ifdef::env-slides[]
. Download the latest version of Neo4j Desktop.
. Create a project in Neo4j Desktop named *Graph Algos*.
. Create a local 4.1.x database in this Graph Algos project.
endif::[]


ifdef::backend-html5,backend-pdf[]
These videos show how to install and get started using Neo4j Desktop.
For your environment you should:

. Download the latest version of Neo4j Desktop.
. Create a project in Neo4j Desktop named *Graph Algos*.
. Create a local 4.1.x database in this Graph Algos project.

== Step 2: Install APOC and GDSL for your database

. Click the *Manage* area for the database.
. Select the *Plugins* tab.
. Install the *APOC* plugin.
. Install the *Graph Data Science* plugin.
. Start the database

//=== Using Neo4j Browser
//
//Neo4j Browser is a tool that enables you to access a Neo4j Database by executing Cypher statements to create or update data in the graph and to query the graph to return data.
//The data returned is typically visualized as nodes and relationships in a graph, but can also be displayed as tables.
//In addition to executing Cypher statements, you can execute a number of system calls that are related to the database being accessed by the Browser.
//For example, you can retrieve the list of queries that are currently running in the server.
//
//You can use Neo4j Browser functionality via the web interface.
//

=== Step 3: Set up Jupyter Notebook on your system

You can install Jupyter Notebook on your system via pip or conda package managers.

==== conda

If you use conda package manager, you can install Jupyter Notebook with:

[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
----

==== pip

You can install Jupyter Notebook with:

[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
pip install notebook
----

If you successfuly installed Jupyter Notebook, you can run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) to open Jupyter Notebook:

[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
jupyter notebook
----

Consult the https://jupyter.org/install[official Jupyter documentation] for more information.

=== Step 4: Download the course notebooks

Download the zip from xxx and unpack it.

=== Step 5: Open a Jupyter Notebook to connect to the Neo4j database.

In this course you will use Jupyter Notebooks.
All the notebooks in this course require a connection to your started Neo4j instance.

Open the 00_Environment.ipynb notebook and follow the steps to test your connection to the Neo4j database.

=== Step 6: Open a Jupyter Notebook to load the data.

In this course you will use Jupyter Notebooks.
All the notebooks in this course require a connection to your started Neo4j instance.

Open the 01_DataLoading.ipynb notebook and follow the steps to load the data.

== Summary

You should now have set up your development environment:
[square]
* Set up Neo4j Desktop on your system and created a database.
* Installed APOC and GDSL for your database.
* Started the database.
* Set up Jupyter Notebook on your system.
* Downloaded the course notebooks.
* Launched a Jupyter Notebook and connected to the Neo4j database.
* Launched a Jupyter Notebook and loaded the data.
