:module-next-title: Importing Data into the Graph

== About this module

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Write Cypher code to import CSV data with Cypher.
* Confirm that the data has been loaded.

== Options for importing data into the graph

You have many options for importing data into Neo4j.
Which option you choose depends on:

[square]
* How much data you have.
* What tools you are comfortable using.
* How much time you have to perform the import.

In this training, we will use Cypher to import data into the graph. This will enable us to control and customize how data is created and refactored as our model changes.
--

== Prepare for the import

[.notes]
--
Before you import data into the graph, you should have an idea of the target graph data model you want to achieve.
You should work with the data architects for your application so that everybody agrees upon:
--

[square]
* Names of entities (node labels).
* Names of relationships.
* Names of properties for nodes and relationships.
* Constraints to be defined.
* Indexes required.
* The most important queries.

[.notes]
--
These graph data model components should be agreed upon before you import the data.

== Review: Steps for loading CSV data with Cypher

[.notes]
--
CSV import is commonly used to import data into a graph.
If you want to import data from CSV, you will need to first develop a model that describes how data from your CSV maps to data in your graph.

Assuming that you have an agreed-upon data model, here are the basic steps you should follow for importing using Cypher and CSV files:
--
[.small]
--
. Determine how the CSV file will be structured.
. Determine if normalized or denormalized data.
. Ensure IDs to be used in the data are unique.
. Ensure data in CSV files is "clean".
. Execute Cypher code to inspect the data.
. Determine if data needs to be transformed.
. Ensure constraints are created in the graph.
. Determine the size of the data to be loaded.
. Execute Cypher code to load the data.
. Add indexes to the graph.

== Review: Using `LOAD CSV`

Here is the simplified syntax for using `LOAD CSV`:

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV     // load csv data
WITH HEADERS // optionally use first header row as keys in "row" map
FROM "url"   // file:// URL relative to $NEO4J_HOME/import or http://
AS row       // return each row of the CSV as list of strings or map
// ... rest of the Cypher statement ...
----

[.notes]
--
You can use `LOAD CSV` for CSV files that contain fewer than 100k lines.

[.student-exercise]
== Exercise 2: Loading airport data

[.notes]
--
Your first import of airline data will use a CSV file with 1K lines so you will use the standard `LOAD CSV` statement.
This CSV file has already been cleaned up and is in a normalized format.
--

[.small]
--
In the query edit pane of Neo4j Browser, execute the browser command:

kbd:[:play 4.0-neo4j-modeling-exercises]

and follow the instructions for Exercise 2.

[NOTE]
This exercise has 7 steps.
Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes.
