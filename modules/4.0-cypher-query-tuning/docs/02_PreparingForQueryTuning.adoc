== About this module

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Describe the components of query processing.
* Use `EXPLAIN` to view the query plan.
* Use `PROFILE` to view the query plan and execution.
* Describe how information is used for query processing:
** node labels
** node degree
** count store
** indexes
** relationships
** properties

== Using `EXPLAIN`

You use the `EXPLAIN` feature of Cypher to view the estimated execution plan for the query.
When using `EXPLAIN`, Neo4j provides information based upon what is in the Page Cache.
This information, however may not match what is in the database.

You can use `EXPLAIN` to identify any queries that have mistakes in them.

==== Example: Query using the wrong property name

A Cypher query may compile with no problem and even execute, but is it constructed correctly?
Suppose we have this query:

image::FullNameWrong.png[FullNameWrong,width=800,align=center]

The Person nodes in this graph do not have a property, _fullName_ that is indexed.
In most cases, you want the starting point for retrieval (the anchor) to use an index.
Here we see that the execution plan will do a scan of all nodes (NodeByLabelScan) with the label _Person_ to find those with the value for fullName.
You don't want to see NodeByLabelScan steps in your execution plan.
Seeing this will raise two questions:

. Should _fullName_ have an index?
. Is the property _fullName_ correct as we would expect to be using an index.

In our graph, we have the following indexes and constraints:

image::Indexes.png[Indexes,width=800,align=center]

Clearly, this query should have used the _name_ property, rather than the _fullName_ property if we want to use an existing index.

Here is the corrected execution plan that will use the index:

image::CorrectedFullName.png[CorrectedFullName,width=800,align=center]

The first step of the execution plan is to use _NodeIndexSeek_ which is what we want to see.

==== Example: Query using the wrong relationship type

In most well-designed graph data models, relationships can be the most efficient way to retrieve data.
Suppose we have this query:

image::RelationshipWrong.png[RelationshipWrong,width=800,align=center]

Here we see that a variable, _DIRECTED_ is specified for the relationship.
That is, we are not specifying a particular relationship type in the query.
We can see in the execution plan that no relationship type is used.
The query is missing the ":" to specify the relationship type.

Here is the corrected query:

image::CorrectedRelationship.png[CorrectedRelationship,width=800,align=center]

And we see the correct syntax for the relationship in the _Expand_ step.


== Using `PROFILE`

Using `PROFILE` is what you use to understand the real work done in a query as it shows the execution plan, but also show the actual number of rows retrieved and passed between steps.

Let's take a deeper look at an execution plan shown using `PROFILE`.

== Summary

You should now be able to:
[square]
* Write Cypher code to implement a simple initial graph data model.
* Confirm that the starter data is in the graph.
